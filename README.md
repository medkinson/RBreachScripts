These scripts are intended for use in Roblox RBreach Revamp experience. The GUI menu with all these scripts is INDEV.
If any function does not work, please open an issue.

Infinite Stamina:
1. Inject InfStamina.lua
2. Press "J" to get infinite stamina (NOTE: if you were respawned then press "J" again to get infinite stamina).

Map Generator:
1. Inject MapGenerator.lua
2. Press "M" to see the map for the current round (NOTE: if round has ended, press "M" again when the new map is complete. Old labels will be automatically deleted).

Teleporting to an item:
1. Change the "item" variable to the name of the item that you want to teleport to (WARNING: currently, this only works for weapons; support for other item types will be added soon).
